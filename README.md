# STM32F_CMSIS_Codes

This is a repository where I added all the codes I done, whilst learning how to program the STM32F407VG discorvery board. There is also a folder titled "Datasheet", where I've added the relevent datasheets for the microcontroller, as well as highlights tips and important information.
